You are required to create an Employee Management Rest API based Web application, where you will be developing CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality along with Sorting and some concepts of security.
Your Rest API should be secure. And should have different endpoints for different operations-
• Get Role Details
• Add a new Role
• Get User Details
• Add a new User
• Save a new Employee
• Read Employee List
• Fetch Employee Data BY Id
• Update an existing Employee
• Delete an existing Employee
• Search Employee BY First Name
• Sort Employee BY First Name IN ASC / DESC Order
